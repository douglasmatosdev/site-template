### First let's read the challenge statement

Welcome to the world of Java! In this challenge, we practice printing to stdout.

The code stubs in your editor declare a Solution class and a main method. Complete the main method by copying the two lines of code below and pasting them inside the body of your main method.
```java
System.out.println("Hello, World.");
System.out.println("Hello, Java.");
```
### Input Format

There is no input for this challenge.

### Output Format

You must print two lines of output:

1. Print ***Hello, World.*** on the first line.
2. Print ***Hello, Java.*** on the second line.

### Sample Output

```bash
Hello, World.
Hello, Java.
```

In the challenge, an initial code is left, which appears right after
```java
public class Solution {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        /* Enter your code here. Print output to STDOUT. Your class should be named Solution. */
    }
}
```

The solution is very simple, just insert the two **println** methods as shown below.

```java
public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        System.out.println("Hello, World.");
        System.out.println("Hello, Java.");
    }
}
```
